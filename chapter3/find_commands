To search for any file in / with the exact name hosts

	#find / -name "hosts"

To search for any file in / containing the word "host" in their name:
( globbing is used.)
	
	#find / -name "*host*"

To search for a file type in / that is bigger that 100M in size:
(type -f denotes filetype of file)
	
	#find / -type f -size +100M



This command line points to /etc for find:
Then -exec points to grep to filter and print only names of files with selected lines (-l), using the string student.
The curly braces {} are used to expand on what is found.
\; delimits the end of the exec command. (\ used as an escape character)

	#find /etc -exec grep -l student {} \;

	similar command:

	#grep -l student /etc/* 2>/dev/null

2>/dev/null ---> redirects error messages to null, so that the output is cleaner.



Finds in /etc all files that are bigger than 100 characters (100bytes), and on these files, grep -l student Will give us all the names that have the word student within the file.
cp {} /tmp will redirect expanded results and copy them to /tmp
2>/dev/null, redirect error messages to null.
	
	#find /etc -size +100c -exec grep -l student {} \; -exec cp {} /tmp \; 2>/dev/null
