Undertanding Links:

* LInks are pointers to files in a different location
* Compare to shortcuts on other operating systems
* LInks can be useful to make the same file available on multiple locations
* Linux uses hard links and symbolic links
* Create hard links with ln and symbolic links with ln -s
* Symbolic links make sure that information that is needed is always available.

to know:

Inode: A data structute describing a file-system object (e.g. file directory) that stores the attributes and disk block(s) locations of the object data.

THe inode(index node) is a data structute in an Unix-like file system that describes a file-system object such as a file or a directory. Each inode stores the attributes and disk block locations of the object's data.
Directories are lists of names assigned to inodes. A directory contains an entry for itself, its parent and each of its children.


working with links examples:

	#ls -il /etc/hosts
	134436 -rw-r--r--. 1 root root 158 Sep 10  2018 /etc/hosts

NOte: The -i will display the inode number.

Creating a hardlink to the etc/hosts file, Using any name and path?review later.The files are essentially the same, if you edit one; it reflects on the other.

	#ln /etc/hosts /root/hardhosts
	
To verify the hardlink has the same properties and inode number, add path to hardlink.
	
	#ls -il /etc/hosts /root/hardhosts
	
	134436 -rw-r--r--. 2 root root 158 Sep 10  2018 /etc/hosts
	134436 -rw-r--r--. 2 root root 158 Sep 10  2018 /root/hardhosts

---Symbolic links

When creating symbolic links, you must specify an absolute path.

	#ln -s /etc/hosts symhosts

	verify:
	#ls -il /etc/hosts /root/hardhosts /root/symhosts
	
	134436 -rw-r--r--. 2 root root 158 Sep 10  2018 /etc/hosts
  	134436 -rw-r--r--. 2 root root 158 Sep 10  2018 /root/hardhosts
	17838247 lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root  10 Apr  8 17:28 /root/symhosts -> /etc/hosts

Note: The name of the file is the only thing that is stored by symbolic links, 8bytes here.
