Working with tar

* tar is the Tape Archiver and was created a while ago

* By default, it does NOT compress data.

* Basic use is to compress, extract or list.
	
	$tar -cvf my_archive.tar /home /etc
	$tar -tvf will show contents of an archive
	$tar -xvf my_archive extracts to the current directory
		*use -C to switch the output path

*to add compression, use -z, -j or -J

Note: again: Linux does not need file extensions. both my_file.tar and my_file, will be recognized by command $file , as tar archives.
