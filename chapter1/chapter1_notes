chapter 1 Notes:

Using red hat enterprise Linux

the most important things that you get in the official RHEL 8 server release is access to the red hat portal. IN addition to updates provided through the Red Hat Network, in particular the Red Hat knowledge base in invaluable

 *CentOs is the community Enterprise Operating System. CentOS started as a recompiled version of RHEL, with all the items that were no available for free removed from the RHEL software.

 *Another distribution related to RHEL is fedora, a completely free source distribution that is available for free. Red Hat uses fedora as the development platform for RHEL. Fedora is a testing ground for RHEL, which is why you shouldn't use for studying RHCSA.

REPOSITORIES----------------------------------------------------------------------

*A repository is the installation source used to installing software. If you're using free software such as Centos, correct repositories are set up automatically and no further action is required.
If you're using Red Hat enterprise Linux, with a subscription, you'll need the subscription manager software to get access to repositories.


SETUP REQUIREMENTS----------------------------------------------------------------

RHEL8
	*1GB RAM
	*10GB disk
	*NIC

RHEL8 book exercises requirements:
	*64-bit platform
	*2GiB RAM
	*20GB disk
	*physical dvd drive or virtual
	*a NIC

Note: The advantage of using the server with a GUI installation pattern is that it provides an easy to use interface, also some tools discussed here only run on a GUI, and you can use multiple terminal windows.


INSTALL NOTE:
RHEL8 by default uses the XFS filesystem. This system cannot be shrunk it can only be expanded, therefore it is sometimes a better choice to use ext4.


INSTALL-NETWORKING:
you must configure a network interface and enable it during OS install, otherwise your server might not be able to connect to any network.
